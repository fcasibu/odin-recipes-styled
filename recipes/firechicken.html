                    (optional)

                <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine hot pepper flakes, hot pepper paste, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, ground black
                    pepper,
                    rice syrup,
                    garlic, and ginger in a bowl. Mix it well into a sweet and spicy paste.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken and mix well by hand.</li>
                <li>Heat up a skillet with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Add the sliced rice cakes and fry them for a few
                    minutes.
                    Turn them
                    over with a spatula once or twice until both sides are crispy and light golden brown.</li>
                <li>Place the marinated chicken into a heavy pan, preferably cast iron. Use the water to rinse the bowl
                    and
                    get
                    the last of
                    the sauce into the pan. Cover and cook over medium high heat for 10 minutes. If you use a normal
                    frying
                    pan,
                    it will
                    take 7 to 8 minutes. Be sure not to burn the chicken.</li>
                <li>Uncover, stir and turn over the chicken with a wooden spoon. Add the rice cakes to the top of the
                    chicken.
                </li>
                <li>Turn down the heat very low. Cover and let cook another 10 minutes, until the chicken is fully
                    cooked.
                    If
                    you're using
                    cheese, pre-heat the oven broiler.</li>
                <li>When the chicken is cooked, put the cheese over the top. Slip it into the oven for a few minutes
                    until
                    the
                    cheese is
                    melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove and sprinkle with the chopped green onion. Serve hot.</li>
